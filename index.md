Hello!

My name is Jorge G. Sancha and I'm one of the founders at [https://tinybird.co](Tinybird.co), where we try to make it really easy for developers to build real-time applications over huge quantities of data.

In the recent past, I was Chief Development Officer at [CARTO](https://carto.com), where I was responsible for Product and Engineering.

In the not so recent past, I ran BeBanjo for 6 years, a SaaS start-up I also co-founded. We sold BeBanjo after signing as clients some of the biggest media brands in the world, from Broadcasters to Hollywood Studios, and to this it continues to be a leader in the Video On Demand industry.

I believe in cross-functional, collaborative teams, who share goals and accountability across disciplines. I write and speak about managing teams, and always love chatting about products and product development.
